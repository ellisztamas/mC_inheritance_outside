    "Does it matter if plants grow outside or in the greenhouse? If so, which life history stages are important? We hypothesise that reproduction is most important, since this is when TEs start becoming expressed, or at germination. To do this we allow plants to go through at least one generation outdoors and observe the effects on the offspring. We would use a site in northern Sweden that Svante will locate for us, because this can be run in parallel with Pieter's experiment.\n",

In year 2, we would also sow seeds harvested in the growth room outdoors, as well as seeds both harvested and then germinated (on agar) in the growth room.

Selfing is not the same as outcrossing, so we can set up some kind of parallel experiment to the pedigree we are running in the growth rooms. Assuming its too difficult (also, too time consuming) to cross parental accessions in the field, we can instead sow F<sub>1</sub>s generated in the growth room in 2019, and resow the resulting F<sub>2</sub> seed."
